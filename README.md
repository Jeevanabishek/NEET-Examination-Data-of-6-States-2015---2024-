# NEET Examination Data of 6 States (2015-2024)
## Project Description
I created an interactive Power BI dashboard that gives insights into student performance, cut-off trends, category-based analysis, and state-level comparisons. This approach included data cleaning and transformation, interactive dashboard design, data visualization and analysis, and DAX formulas/calculations.
